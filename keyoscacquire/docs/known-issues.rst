Known issues and suggested improvements
=======================================

* Issues:

    - There has been an issue with the data transfer/interpretation where the output waveform is not as it is on the oscilloscope screen. If this happens, open *KeySight BenchVue* and obtain one trace through the software. Now try to obtain a trace through this package -- it should now work again. Please report this if this happens.

* Improvements:

    - Make a dynamic default setting for number of points
    - Write tutorial page for documentation
